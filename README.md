# Population Health Management to identify and characterise ongoing health need for high-risk individuals shielded from COVID-19: Cluster Analysis

Code and outputs generated for characterising the shielded population of COVID-19 through Population Health Management segmentation approaches.

Individuals at ‘high risk’ of COVID-19 were identified and patient level data including current chronic conditions, historical healthcare utilisation and demographic and socioeconomic status, were used for analyses.
 
Population segmentation used k-prototypes cluster analysis due to the flexibility to use mixed data types (both continuous and categorical).
